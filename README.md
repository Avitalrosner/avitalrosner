I'm currently a Master's student at [Weizmann](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/pages/), specifically in a rotation at [Shalev's lab](https://shalevlab.weizmann.ac.il/), where I helped establish a new method in the lab - the cell free RNA world :)

Outside of the scientific world, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends, and read load of books ;)
